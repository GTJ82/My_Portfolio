My Personal Portfolio

This a site I built to display my personal projects and a little about myself. You can contact me through various links on the page. I have built in links to my LinkedIn and Github account as well as my resume. You can find all three of these links at the bottom of the home page. My portfolio can be found when you select the hamburger menu in the top right corner of the home page.
