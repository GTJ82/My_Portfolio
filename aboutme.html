    <main>
        <p>I am a freelance web developer. Recently completed a Full Stack Web 
            Development program at UNCC this past January. Eager to learn as much as I can so most of my free time is spent doing just that. When I'm not behind my computer I enjoy spending as much time as possible in the outdoors. My dog is usually no more than 5 feet away form me at all times so I always have a hiking buddy. The world of prograaming is an exciting one and I am happy to be a part of it!
