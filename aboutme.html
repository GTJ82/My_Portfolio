    <Main>
        <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer with leadership experience seeking a new opportunity in Web Development or Software Engineering. In 2017, after building a successful career in Construction Management and owning and operating my own business, I decided to follow my passion and began studying Computer Engineering at Central Piedmont Community College. My coursework at CPCC solidified my passion for computer science which compelled me to pursue further education at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Full Stack Web Development course headed by Jeffrey Hoffman. Upon successfully completing this course, I am well versed in computer languages as outlined below. I look forward to a long and rewarding career in the ever changing industry of web development coupled with motivation to continue my education and training in the field. With great excitement, I am seeking a company with a great culture where I can utilize my skills, grow, and contribute to the overall company success.
